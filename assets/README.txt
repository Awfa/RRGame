Assets are organized as follows:

level 1: type
As required by haxe, assets are partitioned by their type (ie. music, sound, images, ...)

level 2: attribution
All assets must be grouped by their owner in order to give proper credit.
Public domain assets may be grouped in a publicDomain folder.

level 3: assets
assets live here.
an unused/ folder may exist grouping assets that are not being used.
attribution liscense assets will have a attribution.txt file here, stating what credit must be given
