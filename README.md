# RRGame
A rhythm reaction game for the UW Games Capstone course.

# Unit Testing
We are testing using munit, configured to support flixel
https://ashes999.github.io/learnhaxe/integration-testing-in-munit-with-haxeflixel.html

Basically, we use munit to manage our test suite (generate main and suite classes), but we run the tests through lime.

Installation:
1. install munit

Run Tests:
1. Navigate to test/
2. run command 'lime test neko' (html5 throws errors?)

Everything else:
1. run command 'haxelib run munit <command>'
